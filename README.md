# Distributed-System


A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to the users of the system as a single computer. This definition has two aspects. The first one deals with hardware: the machines are autonomous. The second one deals with software: the user think of the system as a single computer. And both are essential. 

In this repository different distributed system technologies (middlewares, frameworks and archtectures) will be implemented.
